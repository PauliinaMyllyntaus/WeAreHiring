# We are Dwarves

Innovation happens. There are many startups found and raise fund every day. They focus on making significant positive changes, impact millions of people, lead to breakthroughs and support the foundation of economic growth.

Building an innovation startup requires lots of different things, and it is tough. Most of them have to deal with business development, legal, fundraising, team recruitment, and product development at the same time. At some points, growing a startup needs a strong and experienced team behind. The software team that can help to design the system, design the database, produce the well-crafted software, keep the system stable, avoid the technical debt and deliver values is one of the critical pieces to solve the puzzle.

**This is where Dwarves Foundation comes in.**
Despite the fact that service firms scale linearly, their ultimate size is capped and small, they don’t have life-changing exits for their founders, we start Dwarves Foundation as we want to build things right. I’ve always felt that companies like Dwarves Foundation are more important to the economy than the mildly pejorative phrase used to describe them.

Found in 2014, Dwarves Foundation is an innovation service firm. [We stand for the craftsmanship](/additional-info/what-we-stand-for.md) in software development.

Dwarf is the small and misshapen creatures in Norse Mythology. Dwarves are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting. They are well known for being the best blacksmiths throughout the nine worlds. The dwarf is an example of a creature who has the ability that surpasses the known world, presaging the rise of a universe beyond this physical realm. Whatever their origin, the dwarf’s existence plays a role in expanding the imagination.

Aspiring to create a positive breakthrough that can be able to rewrite the new world, we chose the name Dwarves Foundation as the commitment to the vision that we follow. This is what we do here. It takes many forms, and we’re always working towards better software craftsmanship.

## Core values

We expect like-minded people

- **Craftsmanship**: We work toward perfection in every single piece that we produce. We are proud of the well-crafted software that we develop together.
- **Teamwork**: Teamwork is all about trust and collaboration. Having someone in the team mean we can rely on this person.
- **Sustainable**: We think long-term. We do not believe in rushing for project and working overtime. We believe in working sustainably and balanced so that we are a happy bunch of sane workers. Software requires good brains to create good codes and good processes.

## We do Agile

We build software. The way we see it is a collaboration between multiple people in the team with sufficient knowledge on the domain and clearly understand the project vision that they can quickly adapt to the changes in the market. We adopt the Agile philosophy at this level.

Also, based on that philosophy, we apply the Scrum framework, which we find out a good fit for us. There are no specific roles in the team at the beginning. There is only the team member who has autonomy and responsibility to meet the goals of the sprint. And there is the Scrum master who is the team member turning into a coach. He works to remove any impediments that are obstructing the team from achieving its sprint goals. The role was supposed to be temporary. A mature team doesn’t need a permanent coach.

## How we hire

Hiring means we need help. We only hire people who tell us what to do, not the other way around. We always look for long-term teammates that why we want to ensure the new hire is a value fit and culture fit.

In general you will be taking through 4 rounds:
- Pre-assessment: We evaluate the logic, English, and the personalities in non-interrupted 30 minutes online test.
- Assignment: Its objective is to gauge the candidate skills, give them an idea of how they approach tasks relevant to the job and provide us with some talking points.
- Interview: In the 60-minute interview, the candidates would know more about Dwarves working style & philosophy, and impress us with their background and skills.
- Culture: This is an occasion for the team to learn more about the candidates in a casual way. Being on this round means that we liked your work. After that, if you are qualified, welcome to the woodland.

We are expecting **Your application form**
  * Who you are and what have you been working on
  * More detailed info related to the position you're applying for
  * Make sure you enter links to your public profiles (i.e. Linkedin, Twitter, GitHub, personal Blog, Behance, Dribbble...)
  * Don't forget to attach portfolio of projects you've been working on (ideally with links for AppStore/PlayStore)
  * Attach references, if you have any

## Our stack and technology

![](images/tech-index.png)

We believe that using technology in appropriate way will help to boost up productivity and make our life better in many aspects. We persue the path of modern technology where we invest a lot of time in new techs and how to apply them to our products.

Having a team of strong engineering culture and product mindset, we use the cutting edge technologies to maximize the product outcome. As a time of writing down, we have

- Go and Elixir for backend development. Where Go is the greatest for API development and Elixir still a potential candidate to replace Ruby on Rails. They're both concurrency language which implemented Actor Model and Reader-Writer Synchonized.
- Native mobile development with Functional Reactive Programming in Android and iOS using RxJava and RxSwift. Cross platfrom technology is still something good for startup but when you want to dig deeper in term of device components or sensors, application performance improvement and so on.
- All the codebase is well-tested. We want everything should be stable and good enough before release date.
- Automation Process with Docker-centric workflow
    + We apply Gitflow and Kanban for product development.
    + We apply CI/CD workflow in [DC/OS](https://dcos.io) (mesos and marathon) or in Kubernetes.
    
    Everytime when the feature is reviewed and approved, it will be tested automatically using Gitlab CI. Then that success version will be pushed into our private Docker Registry. When time comes and the branch master is ready to deploy, Gitlab CI will help to trigger to pull and install the new version.

With those toolset, our development process is boosted up a lot and it's getting interesting.

## Community Contribution

### Golang Vietnam Community

We use Golang as our main backend language of choice to rewrite the modern world and effortlessly scalable services. We help to organize meetups, conferences and other activities. We started [Golang Vietnam Community](https://golang.org.vn) in the beginning of our journey on Jan 2015 and be a part of it till today. 

The first meetup was held on 2015 March with 40 gophers, and it marked the beginning of the Vietnam chapter. Joining the Go User Groups, Golang Vietnam helps to improve the tech scene by providing lots of activities to gather the community in Vietnam.

### GopherCon Vietnam

GopherCon is one of the largest Golang events in the world. Thousand of gophers gather every year to GopherCon to meet and celebrate at the conference together.

As a part of the Golang community, we are pleased to be launching the first [GopherCon Vietnam](https://gophercon.vn) on December 2018, the most significant event in Vietnam dedicated exclusively to Go. A community of a passionate Gophers organizes GopherCon Vietnam on a volunteer basis.
