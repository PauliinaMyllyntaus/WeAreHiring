Not everyone has a clear path to a job in tech industry. It can be particularly difficult for individuals with non-traditional work and educational backgrounds to find full-time roles. For every computer science graduate we hire, we know there are others who could also make a significant impact: people whose work experience is primarily outside of tech and are looking to pivot into the industry; people who have taken time off for caregiving and are coming back into the workforce; and people who don’t have a traditional developer or engineering background (perhaps they are self-taught or participated in a coding program).

With this in mind, we’re proud to launch our new apprenticeship program.

# The Program

Getting inspired by Github, our apprenticeship is a total six-month, paid career development program designed to support individuals with non-traditional work and educational backgrounds. While we already have a successful internship program for full-time college students, we wanted to create a program for people who don’t qualify for traditional internships. The program provides real-world experience to talented individuals who are passionate about tech and are looking to enter the tech industry.

- Work on real projects with a team, and partner with a mentor for help throughout the program
- Develop professional skills and gain insight with feedback and performance reviews from peers, mentors, and managers
- Gain additional learning opportunities and resources provided throughout the program

# About Us

Found in 2014, Dwarves Foundation is an innovation service firm. [We stand for the craftsmanship](/additional-info/what-we-stand-for.md) in software development. Our woodland is a sum of great technology, engineering culture, and smart people. The numbers speak for themselves:

- 5 years in the market
- 40 talented members
- 10 common team size per deployments
- 3 Vietnam Development Communities Influenced

# The Plan

Your first two months are spent learning. At the end of your second month, you'll meet with your Director to discuss your promotion to a full-time dwarf.

If either you or we have decided that Dwarves Foundation is not for you, no worries. We can work with you over the next month to help find job prospects.

We will do everything we can to make your first three months as amazing as we can and prepare you for your next step after the apprenticeship.

# The Syllabus

To make sure your time with us is well-spent, we offer you real projects with our adepts and the chance to work with global customers. Bring your best curiosity and initial to make your way in these open doors:

- Apply basic DevOps: Containerized, Docker, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery
- Speaking multiple languages at once: You will be taught to use Golang as the primary backend language; Agile and Scrum process to manage your work.
- Use GIT for tracking file changes and version control system
- We have Swift for Apple fans to build your iOS applications, and for those who choose to go with Android, we got you covered with Kotlin.
- Be a Vim user or master another editor. Become a CLI user

You will work with your mentor on client projects Monday-Thursday. Your mentor will pair with you during the week as you work on user stories.

Pairing is the fastest and most effective way to learn, so it should be a priority for you and your mentor. However, do not expect to pair 100% of the time. One particularly effective method of pairing is Ping-Ponging. The idea is for Person 1 to write a test, Person 2 writes the code to make the test pass. Then Person 2 writes the next test and Person 1 writes the code to make the test pass. Rinse, repeat.

We also encourage you to pair with other apprentices as well as with other Dwarves who are not your mentor. Everyone on the team loves teaching and learning, and they'd love to teach and learn from you. A good way to do it is to announce during standup that you're looking for someone to pair with, and if people have free time (usually only Fridays, since that's when everyone gets a break from client work), they'll tell you.
