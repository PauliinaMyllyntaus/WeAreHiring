## Home office

If you prefer working from home due to whatever reason, you can choose a few days in a month.

But honestly, we have a beautiful office, it's a lot of fun here, we've got huge screens in front of us, high-speed internet, ergonomic chairs... why would you stay alone at home? :)

We only require you to be online on Slack so that we can contact you if things go wrong and also commit the code regularly so that we see things are going well.

Results are what matters here, not sitting in the office 9-5.
